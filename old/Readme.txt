These are old scripts that I haven't used lately and so I did not bother to
convert them to python3. They are still python2.7.

confDistribution.R and confGraph are scripts that use R to render confidence
graphs from prediction files. I havent' used these in a long time, and don't
have R installed on my laptop. Could resurrect these sometime.
